            <h3>Rebuilding the society</h3>
            <p>
              Burning Man is a network of people inspired by the values
              reflected in the Ten Principles and united in the pursuit of a
              more creative and connected existence in the world. Throughout the
              year we work to build Black Rock City, home of the largest annual
              Burning Man gathering, and nurture the distinctive culture
              emerging from that experience.

            <p>
              Burning Man Project will bring experiences to people in grand,
              awe-inspiring and joyful ways that lift the human spirit, address
              social problems, and inspire a sense of culture, community, and
              civic engagement. Burning Man provides infrastructural tools and
              frameworks to support local communities in applying the Ten
              Principles through six interconnected program areas, including
              Arts, Civic Involvement, Culture, Education, Philosophical Center,

              <p>
                Burning Man is an event focused on community, art,
                self-expression, and self-reliance held annually in the western
                United States. The name of the event comes from its culminating
                ceremony: the symbolic burning of a large wooden effigy,
                referred to as the Man, that occurs on the penultimate night of
                Burning Man, which is the Saturday evening before Labor Day. The
                event has been located since 1991 at Black Rock City in
                northwestern Nevada, a temporary city erected in the Black Rock
                Desert about 100 miles (160 km) north-northeast of Reno. As
                outlined by Burning Man co-founder Larry Harvey in 2004, the
                event is guided by ten principles: radical inclusion, gifting,
                decommodification, radical self-reliance, radical
                self-expression, communal effort, civic responsibility, leaving
                no trace, participation, and immediacy.

                The event originated on June 22, 1986, on Baker Beach in San
                Francisco as a small function organized by Larry Harvey and
                Jerry James, the builders of the first Man. It has since been
                held annually, spanning the nine days leading up to and
                including Labor Day. Over the event's history, attendance has
                generally increased. In 2019, 78,850 people participated in the
                event. In 2021, the unofficial event had an estimated 20,000
                attendees.
